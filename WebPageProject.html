	<p> I was born in Atlanta, Ga on November 2, 1998. Ever since then, I have lived in Newnan, Ga, which is a small town right outside of Atlanta. 
	When I was growing up, I had my hobbies. I loved to play outside in the yard with my older brother and all his friends. 
	I also loved to play sports and in particular, baseball. As I grew older, I began to grow more fond of baseball, and decided to focus a lot of my childhood on playing baseball. 
	Also as a kid, I loved to go camping and hiking. My friends and I would often camp out or go on wilderness trips. Above all, throughout my childhood and still today, I love UGA Football.</p>
	<p> Ever since my parents started taking me to UGA Football games as a kid, UGA was the only place that I could possibly 
	ever dream about attending. When I was in high school, I focused a lot on my school work because I knew what kind of diligence
	and excellence that it would require to attend such a prestigious university that is the University of Georgia. As soon as I applied to UGA I already could not wait to know 
	if I had been accepted. Thankfully, I was admitted to UGA and have already completed my first year. I am currently
	still enrolled at UGA in my sophomore year, and it only gets better. Currently, I have decided to major in accounting, however, things like those are 
	always subject to change.</p>
	<p> Although I am still a sophomore in college, I do have many goals that I hope to achieve not only in the next couple of 
years but more importantly for the rest of my life. I have a big goal that I have set for myself to graduate college with above a 3.5 GPA, and although it may not be 
easy, I look forward to achieving my goal in the next couple of years. I also have some more long term goals such meeting a wife and starting a family.
I also hope that I can continue a family tradition with having season tickets to UGA Football games, as I know both my parents and grandparents will cherish their times at Sanford Stadium forever.	</p>
